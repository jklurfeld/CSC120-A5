Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
Association was helpful because makes it so I can break down the problem more and have less code in one file. Because it's more theoretical and you're not really writing anything in your code that says that you're associating two files, it honestly didn't feel that different.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I wanted to use the String method repeat(), which I found on the java doc website, but it couldn't find that method and I think it was because I don't have a new enough version of java, so I just had to use for loops instead, which wasn't that big of an issue. Using the escape characters made making the ASCII art a little bit harder. Advice I would give to someone in the future is to think through the issue and how to resolve it rather than trial and error and just running your code a million times, which is what I did at the beginning.
